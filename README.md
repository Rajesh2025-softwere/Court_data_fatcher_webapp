üèõÔ∏è e-Courts Case Tracker
Project Description
The e-Courts Case Tracker is a powerful Python-based web application designed to automate the process of tracking case listings in Indian District and High Courts. It provides a crucial service to legal professionals and litigants by eliminating the manual, time-consuming process of searching daily court schedules (known as cause lists).

The application focuses on two key features: proactive alerting and data management. It ensures users are instantly notified of upcoming hearings and provides convenient, formatted access to historical and current court data.
